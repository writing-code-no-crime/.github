In open court on Friday morning, prosecutors told the judge that they were weighing the possibility of criminally charging a general partner at Dragonfly Capital for his involvement with Tornado Cash, leading to him refusing to testify in Roman Storm's defense.

NEW YORK — Prosecutors told a federal judge in open court on Friday that they were considering criminally charging certain employees of crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly Capital, including general partner Tom Schmidt, for their 2020 investment into privacy tool Tornado Cash.

The discussion between prosecutor Nathan Rehn and District Judge Katherine Polk Failla of the Southern District of New York (SDNY) came amid a break in the ongoing trial of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who has been charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering, conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiracy to violate international sanctions for his work with the privacy tool — charges for which, if found guilty, he faces up to 45 years in prison.
